Responsive CV Template [Built for Github Pages in Jekyll] 
===============================================

[Check out the Demo](https://koalabear.github.io/Jekyll-CV/)

## Try it out

1. Fork & Clone the repository
2. Customize your content
3. Set your 'Github Pages' branch on your Repo's settings
4. Enter your brand new site :)

### Customizing

The template can be mainly customized by writing under the `_collections` subfolders & the `index.md` page. They all contain all the available parameters that the template supports, on your very own forked version :)

#### Localization

Feel free to edit some preset texts under `_layouts/default.html`.

#### Sidebar

The sidebar contains all of the sections (`X_section` variables) set under `_config.yml`. Simple change the value to zero in order to disable them (or anything else to activate).

#### Content Types

The template currently contains `Experience` | `Education` | `Projects` | `Skills` | `Awards/Certificates` sections.
Feel free to add your own & submit them to the repo for others to use / Request some others by opening a thread on this repo :)
